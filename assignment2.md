## The Annual Tuition Increase of Private Schools for celebrity kids in Los Angeles

### Have you ever wondered the price celebrity parents pay annually for exclusive private schools in Los Angeles? Well, I certainly do. It's a known practice for celebrity parents to send their kids to private schools instead of public schools to ensure their child's privacy, safety, and better opportuntities. Due to my interest in this lucrative topic, I plan to make a data set of the five most-expensive private schools celebrity parents send their kids to in Los Angeles. This is a plausible data set that could turn into a story because the interest in these numbers could further increase the tuition prices of the five most-expensive private schools, which then could decrease the student enrollment rate to these schools in upcoming years. Or, vice versa perhaps.

### What I would like to know:
* What is the yearly tuition change since 2015 of the five-most expensive priavte schools in Los Angeles?
* What makes these schools so expensive?
* What areas are they located in?
* What is the student enrollment population since 2015 in each school?

### To collect this data, I researched the yearly tuition change since 2015 of the five-most expensive priavte schools in Los Angeles. Below are my findings.
