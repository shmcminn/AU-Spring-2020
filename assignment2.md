## The Annual Tuition Increase of Private Schools for Celebrity Kids in California

### Have you ever wondered the price celebrity parents pay annually for exclusive private schools (K-12) in California? Well, I certainly do. It's a known practice for celebrity parents to send their kids to private schools instead of public schools to ensure their child's privacy, safety, and better opportuntities. Due to my interest in this lucrative topic, I plan to make a data set of the five most-expensive private schools celebrity parents send their kids to in California. This is a plausible data set that could turn into a story because the interest in these numbers could further increase the tuition prices of the five most-expensive private schools, which then could decrease the student enrollment rate to these schools in upcoming years. Or, vice versa perhaps.

### What I would like to know:
* What is the yearly tuition change since 2016 of the five-most expensive priavte schools in California?
* What makes these schools so expensive?
* What areas are they specifically located in?
* What is the student enrollment population since 2016 in each school?

### To collect this data, I researched the yearly tuition change since 2016 of the five-most expensive priavte schools (K-12) in California. I recieved this data from each schools official admission websites. Estimations of my findings are below:
