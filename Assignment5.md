### For my final project, I plan to analyze what region of the country (city or state) are black women reported to die the most from preganacy related deaths in 2019. 

### According to an American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists study, it's reported that black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications compared to white women. And shockingly, more than a third of these pregnancy-related deaths were caused by mistreatment or misdiagnosis of cardiovascular conditions, according a CDC report.

### Due to this clear data-driven disparity from this demographic of people, my topic is timely, significant, and relevant enough to shed light on. I personally haven't seen much stories that discussed this speciic topic, so I know my story will provide readers with nuanced perspectives. My news hook will tie into answering questions that haven't been sufficiently adressed in this conversation.

### Such questions will be: what region of the country produced the most pregancy related death for black women in 2019, what socio-economic factors caused these deaths in this region, and what preventative measures took place in this region to reduce this frequency. 

### Some data sources I plan to use are 2019 studies and reports from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

### The elements of the data that will be good candiates to visualize will be the amount (statistics) of black women that died from preganancy related complications the most in a region and the various reasons for these deaths in the regions compared to the larger U.S. landscape.
