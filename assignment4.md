### Have you ever wondered what ride-sharing mode of transporation President Trump supports? Well, I found that President Trump supported uber during the 2019 candidacy yearâ€”which left lyft behind.

### To find this data: 
1. I went to [FEC.gov](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidate/P80001571/?tab=spending) and clicked on 'spending'.
2. I clicked on 'download' to export the 2019 data in CSV file.
3. I deleted all rows that were not contributions made to uber.
4. I used the 'auto summation' feature to add the amount of contributions made to uber.

### As a result of my investigation, President Trump sent 2,365 contributions to the uber company that amounted to $40,583.85 during 2019. In the data, there were no payments made ot lyft, which is uber's top ride-sharing competitor. Thus, my story pitch is that President Trump supported uber during 2019, but did uber support Trump back? To follow up on this bigger story, I want to investigate if uber made signicant contributions to the president's republican candidacy during 2019. To find this data, I would similarly use the FEC.gov website to search through the 'raising' section of President Trump's records. I would then download the 2019 data of fundraising contributions and search if uber made any donations.
