### Have you ever wondered what ride-sharing mode of transportation President Trump supports? Well, I found that President Trump supported Uber during the 2019 candidacy year

### To find this data:
1.	I went to FEC.gov and clicked on 'spending'.
2.	I clicked on 'download' to export the 2019 data in an CSV file.
3.	I deleted all rows that were not contributions made to Uber.
4.	I used the 'auto summation' feature to add the amount of contributions made to Uber.


### As a result of my investigation, President Trump sent 2,365 contributions to the Uber company that amounted to $40,583.85 during 2019. In the data, there were no payments made to Lyft, which is Uber's top ride-sharing competitor. Thus, my story pitch is that President Trump supported Uber during 2019, but did Uber support Trump back? To follow-up on this story, I want to investigate if Uber made significant contributions to the president's candidacy during 2019. To find this data, I would use the FEC.gov website to search through the 'raising' section of President Trump's records. I would then download the 2019 data of fundraising contributions and search if Uber made any donations.

### Lead: President Trump Supported Uber during 2019, but did Uber Support Trump Back?

### Nut Graf: The Federal Election Committee shows that President Trump sent 2,365 contributions to Uber that amounted to $40,583.85 during 2019. 

### Did Uber make any similar contributions back? I'd be happy to investigate.
